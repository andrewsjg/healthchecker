# healthchecker

This is a utility to run simple health checks against various things and take some action. It is designed to be modular and extendable.

- Added API and frontend. First attempt at embedding a Vue frontend and writing VueJs. Probably very ugly!

NOTES:

- Currently only supports simple ping checks against hosts and can send a ping to healthcheck.io
- The checks are driven by an yaml config file an example of which doesnt yet exist in this repo
- Current main branch probably doesnt work
