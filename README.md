# healthchecker

This is a utility to run simple health checks against various things and take some action. It is designed to be modular and extendable.

NOTES: 
    - Currently only supports simple ping checks against hosts and can send a ping to healthcheck.io
    - The checks are driven by an yaml config file an example of which doesnt yet exist in this repo
